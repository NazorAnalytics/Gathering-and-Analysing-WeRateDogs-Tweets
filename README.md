# Gathering-and-Analysing-WeRateDogs-Tweets
This project showcases data gathering and wrangling skills .
It is carried out using three different datasets concerning WeRateDogs twitter page.

One of the datasets which is a tsv file is gathered directly from the web using requests library.
The second is loaded from the local computer, while the third is scraped directly from twitter using twitter APIs.
It is saved as a csv file and then read into a pandas data frame.

The data frames were assessed individually and cleaned. They were then merged into one dataframe for the analysis process.
